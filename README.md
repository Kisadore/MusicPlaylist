### Reflection

Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

* Yes, Lab three really helped when it came down to Fetching Data.

If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
* I would implement stretch features and go through my code to make it more clean. I would also play around with the layout so when the playlist cards are hovered over, they dont overlay the other cards.

Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

* Overall, it went really well. One thing I want to start doing that my peers did was using Dev tools and geting layout inspiration from already published sites.
